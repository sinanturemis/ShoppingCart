## Inheritance Dependency Diagram

This is the general structure of the classes.

![Dependency Diagram](SolutionItems/DependencyDiagram.png)

### Product
This object has title, unit price and category properties. Also, contains a method **GetAllCategories** to get current and its ancestors categories.

### Category
This object has Title and ParentCategory properties. In addition, there are two methods ** HasParent ** and ** GetParent **.

### Discount
This is an abstract class to inherit Campaign and Coupon. Calculates discount with ** CalculateDiscount ** method by using ** DiscountStrategy **.

### Campaign
** Campaign ** is a concrete class of ** Discount **. It has ** IsApplicable ** method to understand if order quantity is suitable for the campaign.

### Coupon
This is another concrete class of ** Discount **. As ** Campaign ** has, this class has ** IsApplicable ** method to understand if minimum purchase amount is suitable for the coupon.

### DiscountConcrete
Because its not possible to create an instance from abstract classes, we need to create an concrete object to test this kind of classes. This is a fake class to write unit tests for the ** Discount **.

### IDiscountStrategy
This interface is a contract for the user of discount strategies (for now, they are ** RateBasedDiscountStrategy ** and ** AmountBasedDiscountStrategy **). Thanks to this approach, a new discount strategy can be implemented without any change requirement in user class.

### DiscountBase
This class is another abstract class. It implements the ** IDiscountStrategy ** and basicly, it holds the discount value and give a base to ** RateBasedDiscountStrategy ** and ** AmountBasedDiscountStrategy **.

### RateBasedDiscountStrategy
This class is a discount calculation class. Responsibility of this is calculating a rate based discount. It overrides the ** CalculateDiscount ** method with following formula.

$$(amount * DiscountValue) / 100$$

### AmountBasedDiscountStrategy
This is another discount calculation class. We can name it also as 'Fixed Discount'. It just returns discount amount.
